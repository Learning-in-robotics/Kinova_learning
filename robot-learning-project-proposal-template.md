## Project Description

Our project,VR-PPL, aims to address the challenge of enabling Kinova Gen3 robots to autonomously perform pick and place tasks through the power of machine learning and computer vision.

* What robot problem you want to address?
  *  The problem we are tackling involves the fundamental robotic task of picking objects from one location and placing them in another. While this may seem simple to humans, it remains a complex challenge for robots due to the variability in object shapes, sizes, and placements, making it a quintessential problem in robotics. Furthermore, robots often need to adapt to dynamic and unstructured environments, making it essential to teach them the skill of pick and place in a versatile manner.
    
* Why this problem is relevant for robotics?
  *  This problem is highly relevant for robotics for several reasons. First, automation and robotics have become integral to industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. Efficient pick and place operations can significantly enhance productivity and reduce operational costs in these sectors. Secondly, robots can play a vital role in tasks that are dangerous or impractical for humans, such as handling hazardous materials or repetitive tasks, further highlighting the relevance of solving this problem.
    
* Why learning might be a suitable solution to the problem?
  * Learning-based approaches are particularly suitable for addressing this challenge. Learning allows robots to adapt and generalize from a wide range of scenarios and variations they encounter in the real world. By employing machine learning and computer vision, we can teach the Kinova Gen3 robot to recognize and adapt to different objects, pick them up with precision, and place them in a desired location with dexterity. The ability to learn from videos makes the system flexible and versatile, as it can continuously improve its performance based on real-world experiences, ultimately leading to more capable and autonomous robots in pick and place applications.

## Learning Techniques

Briefly describe which concrete learning technique(s) you plan to use to achieve the goals of your project.

If you plan to adapt a concrete approach from the literature (e.g. you want to follow a specific paper in your implementation), provide a brief description of the approach and why it might be suitable for your problem.

## Learning Data

Briefly describe the data that you need / plan to use for solving the learning problem. If you use an existing dataset, shortly explain how the dataset fits your problem and whether you need to do any (re)labelling to fit your purpose; if you need to collect your own data, describe how you plan to collect the data (e.g. what simulation environment you plan to use).

## Expected Project Outcomes

List and briefly describe the main expected outcomes of your project (e.g. a simulation environment or a trained policy for your problem of interest).

## Evaluation Plan

Shortly describe how you plan to evaluate the learning success in your problem (e.g. if you train a robot policy, how you will evaluate its generalisation capabilities).
