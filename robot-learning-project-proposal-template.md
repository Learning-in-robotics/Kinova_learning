## Short Project Description

Write a short description of your project. In the description, cover the following aspects:

* What robot problem you want to address
* Why this problem is relevant for robotics
* Why learning might be a suitable solution to the problem

## Learning Techniques

Briefly describe which concrete learning technique(s) you plan to use to achieve the goals of your project.

If you plan to adapt a concrete approach from the literature (e.g. you want to follow a specific paper in your implementation), provide a brief description of the approach and why it might be suitable for your problem.

## Learning Data

Briefly describe the data that you need / plan to use for solving the learning problem. If you use an existing dataset, shortly explain how the dataset fits your problem and whether you need to do any (re)labelling to fit your purpose; if you need to collect your own data, describe how you plan to collect the data (e.g. what simulation environment you plan to use).

## Expected Project Outcomes

List and briefly describe the main expected outcomes of your project (e.g. a simulation environment or a trained policy for your problem of interest).

## Evaluation Plan

Shortly describe how you plan to evaluate the learning success in your problem (e.g. if you train a robot policy, how you will evaluate its generalisation capabilities).

## References

Include a list of any relevant references here.
